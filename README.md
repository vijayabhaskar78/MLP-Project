## System Threat Forecaster
### Can You Forewarn a System Before It’s Compromised?

### Overview
Welcome to the System Threat Forecaster, a Machine Learning Project (MLP T12025) from my BS Degree at IIT Madras. This project tackles the critical challenge of predicting whether a system will succumb to malware infections. Using telemetry data from antivirus software, I developed a model to forecast infection probabilities based on system properties. It’s an exciting fusion of data science and cybersecurity—ideal for anyone eager to safeguard digital landscapes!

### The Challenge
**Goal:** Predict the likelihood of malware infection (0 or 1) using system properties.

**Dataset:** Real-world telemetry data from antivirus threat reports, rich with numerical and categorical features.

**Evaluation:** Measured by accuracy_score()—every prediction matters!

**Deadline:** Kicked off on Dec 26, 2024; set to conclude by Mar 19, 2025.

### My Journey: Hardships & Triumphs
Real-world data is chaotic, and this project was no exception. Here’s how I transformed obstacles into breakthroughs:

- **Missing Values:** Some columns had over 40% missing data! I dropped those and filled the rest—medians for numerical features, most frequent values for categories.
- **Outliers:** Numerical features showed extreme values. I applied the IQR method to trim them, boosting model robustness.
- **Complex Features:** Date and version strings were tricky. I crafted features like *DaysBetweenASandOS* and split version numbers into meaningful components.

### Approach: From Chaos to Clarity
#### Data Loading & Exploration:
- Loaded `train.csv` and `test.csv` using Pandas.
- Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize missing values and outliers—bar plots and boxplots steered my preprocessing.

#### Data Preprocessing:
- Eliminated columns with >40% missing data.
- Filled gaps: categorical with mode, numerical with median.
- Trimmed outliers with IQR for cleaner data.

#### Feature Engineering:
- Converted dates into *DaysBetweenASandOS*.
- Split version columns (e.g., *EngineVersion*) into numerical sub-features for deeper insights.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Histograms showed distributions; bar plots revealed categorical trends.
- Correlation heatmaps exposed feature relationships.

#### Model Selection & Training:
- Started with a `DummyClassifier` to set a baseline.
- Moved to `LogisticRegression`, noting early improvements.
- Experimented with `RandomForestClassifier` using a pipeline for scaling and encoding, seeing better results.
- Settled on `CatBoostClassifier` for its native categorical data handling and top-tier performance.

#### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Optimized `RandomForestClassifier` with `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- Fine-tuned `CatBoostClassifier` with `iterations=1000`, `learning_rate=0.05`, and early stopping to avoid overfitting.

#### Evaluation & Submission:
- Divided data into 80% training and 20% validation.
- Assessed performance with accuracy and AUC on the validation set.
- Produced `submission.csv` with id and target for the test set.

### Results
**Best Model:** `CatBoostClassifier`

**Validation AUC:** 0.6823

**Training Highlights:** The CatBoost model, trained with early stopping, hit its peak AUC of 0.6823 at iteration 662 out of 1000. It outperformed the `DummyClassifier`, `LogisticRegression`, and `RandomForestClassifier`, showing consistent AUC gains throughout training.

### How to Run It
#### Clone the Repo:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-link]
cd system-threat-forecaster
```

#### Run the Notebook:
- Launch the provided Jupyter Notebook.
- Run all cells to preprocess, train, and predict.

#### Check Output:
- Locate `submission.csv` in the working directory.

### What’s Next?
- **Feature Boost:** Explore advanced feature engineering, like interaction terms.
- **Model Ensemble:** Blend CatBoost with XGBoost or LightGBM for a performance lift.
- **Explainability:** Use SHAP to analyze feature importance and uncover malware predictors.

### Why This Matters
This project is more than code—it’s a stride toward secure systems. I’ve sharpened my skills in data wrangling, feature engineering, and model optimization while addressing a pressing real-world issue. Recruiters, heads up: I’m primed to bring this analytical prowess to your team!
